#### Overview

[Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) is used for tracking traffic patterns on your website. It is such a powerful, yet easy-to-use, product. By default, Magento Community edition provides the option to add Google Analytics code for frontend store. When a Magento merchant wants to track the backend Magento admin page views made by their sales team or admin users, there is no default option to add Google Analytics code for backend Magento admin pages. This extension will provide the option to add Google Analytics code for backend Magento admin pages. Check your Google Analytics [dashboard](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) to track the backend Magento admin page views.
